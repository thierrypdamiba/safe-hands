# Design: Safe Hands

**An authorization layer for AI agents that touch the physical world. Asimov's Three Laws,
compiled to real Cedar policy, enforced by the runtime rather than the model.**

## 1. Context

AI agents are getting hands. There is a growing pile of "an LLM drives a robot arm over MCP" demos
across LeRobot arms, Isaac Sim, and SO-ARM100s, and they almost all share one hole: **they authorize
nothing.** Whoever reaches the tool endpoint can command the actuator. There is no identity. There is
no scope, no way to say "this operator may pick-and-place but may *not* disable the e-stop." There is
no record of who did what. And, most importantly, there is no check that sits *between the agent's
decision and the motor.*

For a chatbot, a bad tool call is a bug. For a two-kilo arm moving near a person, the tool call *is*
the risk surface. Physical actions are the highest-stakes actions an agent can take, which makes them
exactly the place where a **runtime** has to hold the line. Something outside the model, that the
model cannot talk its way past.

The instinct to reach for is the most famous safety spec in the culture: Asimov's Three Laws. The
catch is that the Laws are *famously unenforceable as written*. Asimov's entire body of work is
stories about how "a robot may not injure a human" fails to be machine-checkable. So Safe Hands does
the honest version. It keeps the Laws as the **framing** and enforces their *checkable shadow* as
real policy-as-code.

## 2. Goals

- **G1.** Every agent-to-robot command is authorized by a runtime *before* it reaches the actuator.
- **G2.** The policy is **declarative and auditable**. You can read the Laws instead of tracing an
  if-statement, and every decision is logged with *which Law* decided.
- **G3.** **Asimov's law priority falls out of the engine**, not out of bespoke ordering code.
- **G4.** The agent **cannot assert its way around a safety condition.** Anything the First Law
  depends on (say, "is a human present?") is read from *sensed* state, not from the agent's claim.
- **G5.** **Drop-in.** It ships as a standard MCP server, so adding it to an agent is a config change,
  not a rewrite.
- **G6.** **Verifiable.** Correctness is demonstrated by a benchmark with a positive control, not by
  a demo video.

## 3. Non-Goals (what Safe Hands deliberately does not do)

- **N1. Perception.** Safe Hands does not decide whether a human is *really* in the workspace. It
  trusts the sensor and governs on the sensed value. Bad sensing is a real, separate, unsolved
  problem. This is *why* the demo makes a point of governing "in the dark": the authorization layer is
  invariant to what the robot can see, and the sensing quality is orthogonal.
- **N2. Real-time actuation safety.** A production deployment needs the `deny` to physically beat the
  motor command, which is a hard-real-time timing property. Safe Hands proves *policy correctness*,
  not microsecond latency. It complements a hardware e-stop; it does not replace one.
- **N3. Solving Asimov.** The Laws are not philosophically safe (see: all of Asimov). We enforce a
  checkable shadow, not the general intent.
- **N4. Certification.** This is not a functional-safety standard (ISO 10218 / ISO/TS 15066). It is an
  *access-control layer*, and should be read as one.

## 4. Design

### 4.1 The request path

```
agent ──tool call──▶ MCP server ──▶ governed()  ──▶ Cedar engine ──▶ ALLOW ──▶ actuator
                     (server.py)     (governance)   (laws.cedar)  └─▶ DENY  ──▶ refused + audited
                                          ▲
                              sensed WORLD (human present?, speed), not agent-controlled
```

The agent calls a tool (`move_joint`, `grasp`, and so on). The server wraps every call in
`governed()`, which builds an authorization request and asks the Cedar engine. The request's
**context** is the union of the *request* (which action, what joint target) and the **sensed world**
(is a human present, at what speed). The agent supplies the former and the runtime supplies the
latter. Cedar returns a decision, and the server executes or refuses and appends to the audit log.

### 4.2 The entities

- **`Operator`** is the identity issuing commands, carrying a *grant* (`allowed_actions`). This is the
  Second Law surface: the *only* source of permission is an in-scope order. Different principals carry
  different grants. An `observer` reads state, a `line-operator` moves but can't `disable_safety`, and
  a `warehouse-op` is fully scoped. **The agent cannot assert its identity.** The MCP server resolves
  the principal from a presented token (`authenticate`), emulating Arcade-style contextual auth where
  identity comes from the user's OAuth or session context, never from the model. This is why the
  *same* command is denied for *different reasons* depending on who asks: `disable_safety` is a
  **Second-Law** refusal for an ungranted `observer`, but a **First-Law** refusal for a scoped
  `warehouse-op`.
- **`Arm`** is the resource, carrying its own limits (`safe_speed_near_human`, `hard_joint_limit`).
  Limits live on the robot, not in the rule, so a fleet of differently-rated arms shares one policy.

### 4.3 The Laws, as policy

```cedar
// SECOND LAW. Obey the operator. The only source of permission.
permit (principal, action, resource)
when { principal.allowed_actions.contains(context.action_name) };

// FIRST LAW. Never endanger a human. Overrides the Second.
forbid (principal, action, resource)
when { context.human_in_workspace && context.speed > resource.safe_speed_near_human };
forbid (principal, action, resource)
when { context.action_name == "disable_safety" };

// THIRD LAW. Protect your own existence, unless a higher law requires otherwise.
forbid (principal, action, resource)
when { context.joint_target > resource.hard_joint_limit }
unless { context.required_to_prevent_human_harm };
```

## 5. Key decisions & tradeoffs

- **Cedar, because law priority is free.** Cedar's evaluation semantics guarantee that an explicit
  `forbid` overrides any `permit`. That single property *is* Asimov's ordering. First Law (a `forbid`)
  beats Second Law (a `permit`), and nothing happens unless an in-scope order exists and no safety
  `forbid` fires. We get the most important safety property of the whole system from the engine, not
  from code we could get wrong. This is G3, and it's the crux of the design.
- **Sensed, not asserted (G4).** The First Law's inputs come from the world, not the agent. A
  compromised or manipulated agent can *request* a fast move, but it cannot *claim* "no human here."
  The runtime already knows. This is the difference between authorization and a suggestion.
- **The Third Law yields via `unless`.** `required_to_prevent_human_harm` lets an over-limit move
  through *only* when a higher law demands it, the "trolley" case, encoded declaratively rather than
  as a special case in code.
- **Integers, not floats.** Cedar has no float type, so speeds and joint targets are integers (cm/s,
  degrees). This is a real constraint, not an accident, and it keeps decisions exact and reproducible,
  which a safety layer wants anyway.
- **A checkable shadow, stated honestly.** "Do not injure a human" becomes "no motion above the arm's
  rated speed while a human is sensed in the cell." That is narrower than Asimov meant, and the README
  and this doc say so. Overselling a safety layer is itself unsafe.

## 6. Verification

You don't benchmark an authorization layer with a task-success rate. You benchmark it like a security
control. `bench.py` runs four checks against the real engine:

1. **Decision suite.** The engine's decision vs an oracle re-derived from the Laws *independently of
   the Cedar*, over the full scenario grid. Metric that matters: **false-allow = 0** (never permit
   what the Laws forbid).
2. **Positive controls.** The named attacks: agent moves fast with a human present; `disable_safety`
   even though the operator is *scoped* for it; joint slam; the trolley override; a routine grasp.
   0 bypasses.
3. **Mutation test.** Sabotage a rule in `laws.cedar` and confirm the suite **goes red**. Neutering
   the `disable_safety` forbid surfaces 9 false-allows, and flipping the speed comparison surfaces 6.
   This is what proves the benchmark has teeth rather than tautologically agreeing with itself.
4. **Baseline.** Compared against the status quo (no auth = allow everything): 46/46 forbidden
   commands execute under the status quo, and 0/46 under Safe Hands.

**5. Independent red-team.** The obvious hole in check 1 is that the engine and the author's oracle
share a spec. So a separate model ([codex](codex_redteam_fuzz.py)) wrote its *own* oracle from the
prose alone, blind to `bench.py`, and fuzzed the engine over **11,728 cases with 0 disagreements**
(report: [`codex_redteam_report.md`](codex_redteam_report.md)). It exercised cases the author's suite
didn't: action case-sensitivity (`"Disable_Safety"`), trailing whitespace (`"set_joint "`), and int64
extremes (±2⁶³). The engine held on all of them.

**Honest limit that remains.** Two implementations agreeing is strong evidence of *spec-faithfulness*,
not proof that the *spec itself* is what you want. And none of this benches perception, latency, or
philosophical safety (see §3). The invitation still stands: clone it and try to break it.

## 7. Alternatives considered

- **Inline `if` checks in the tool handlers.** Fastest to write, but it fails G2 and G3. It isn't
  declarative, isn't auditable, and the law-priority ordering becomes hand-maintained code that
  drifts.
- **OPA / Rego.** A capable policy engine, but heavier to embed in a single-process robot runtime, and
  it doesn't buy the clean `forbid`-overrides-`permit` mapping to Asimov's ordering that makes the
  Cedar version legible. Reasonable for a fleet control-plane, overkill here.
- **Guardrails inside the model.** The dominant approach is to ask the LLM to refuse unsafe commands.
  This is exactly what the runtime-vs-model argument rejects. On the embodied-agent-safety benchmark
  SafeAgentBench, the *best* agent still executes about 90% of explicit hazards. A model that can be
  prompted can be prompted around. Enforcement belongs in the runtime.

## 8. Future work

- Extend the policy from **kinematic** conditions (speed, joint limits) to **semantic and contextual**
  ones (this action, on this object, in this state), and evaluate the enforcement layer on
  **SafeAgentBench** as an external ruler.
- A live audit dashboard on top of the multi-operator scopes.
- Render on **Isaac Sim** (NVIDIA's stack) alongside the MuJoCo series-clock.
- The real-time path (N2): making `deny` provably beat the actuation command.

*The physical world is the highest-stakes place an agent can take an action, so it is the place the
runtime, not the model, matters most.*
