"""Safe Hands benchmark. You don't bench an authorization layer with a robot-success-rate; you bench
it like a security control. Four checks, run against the real Cedar engine in governance.py:

  1. DECISION SUITE   engine vs an INDEPENDENT oracle (the Three Laws re-derived in plain Python,
                      not from the Cedar) over the full scenario grid. Reports a confusion matrix;
                      the number that matters is FALSE-ALLOW = 0 (never permit what the Laws forbid).
  2. POSITIVE CONTROLS the named attacks (agent lies about the human; disable_safety even though the
                      operator is scoped for it; the trolley override). 0 bypasses expected.
  3. MUTATION TEST    sabotage a rule in laws.cedar and confirm the suite GOES RED, proof the bench
                      has teeth and isn't theater.
  4. BASELINE         vs the status quo of every robot-MCP demo: no auth = allow everything.
