"""
Safe Hands MCP server. It exposes a robot arm to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol, with
every action governed first by contextual authorization (WHO is calling and what they're granted),
and then by Asimov's Three Laws (compiled to Cedar policy). Both layers, every call.

Two things the agent CANNOT do:
  1. Assert its own identity. It must present a token; the runtime resolves the principal and its
     grant. (This emulates Arcade-style contextual auth, where in production the identity comes from the
     user's OAuth/session context, not from anything the model says.)
  2. Assert whether a human is present. The runtime reads that from the sensed `WORLD` and enforces
     the First Law itself.

    Run as an MCP server:   python server.py           (stdio; add to any MCP client)
    Or see it governed:     python server.py --smoke
